        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Some people say I am an interesting fellow. I actually find <strong>that</strong> interesting, since I consider myself a simple guy. Simple. at least, is how I think things should be. And I do not consider me or anyone particularly important. I am aware of our cosmic insignificance.</p>
        <p>Although I have worked for a web portal during the .com bubble, I then moved on to finance and my web skills became rusted.. While I kept the habbit of looking at the source code of web pages, I grew to believe CSS and HTML 5 were rather difficult. Javascript seemed to be  enhanced by how it can affect the page using CSS.</p>
        <p>Aside from finance and web, and being a daddy for my two boys, I find time to do some cool stuff... So here are some of the things I do as a hobby:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Fly airplanes and helicopters. Yes, I'm an IFR-rated pilot. The sky is my therapist. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06zu0t78I1c">Ferrying a Cirrus from Duluth, MN to Brazil</a> was a very cool flight experience.</li>
          <li>Build and fly multirotor drones, then make <a target="_blank" href="https://vimeo.com/93898129">videos.</a></li>  
          <li>Ski. Lots of it.</li>
          <li>Scuba Dive or just boat around.</li>
          <li>Fix and build stuff in general.</li>
          <li>Read. I like <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayn_Rand">Ayn Rand</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Dawkins">Richard Dawkins</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Hawking">Stephen Hawking</a> in particular.</li>
          <li>Cook, eat and drink well.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>That's it for a short list, but since I've been around for quite some time now, there is more to it then this short page. Maybe over a beer I can tell you more about me and learn about you, too!</p>
